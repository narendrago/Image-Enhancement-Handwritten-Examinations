# Image-Enhancement-Handwritten-Examinations

- Due to the onset of pandemic in 2019, all of us are now engaged in work/education **remotely**. Remote examination softwares are in the trend with features like automated submission, noise and object detection, proctoring etc.
- Students in such systems, are generally expected to upload **images** of their answer scripts, for each of the questions. Due to exam coercion and uploading device limitations (like RAM, camera quality etc.), the answer script images recieved at the evaluator's end may be blurred/shaken. This makes the evaluation process difficult and students may therefore lose deserving marks.
- The proposed system aims at developing model(s) for enhancing such images.

# KOHTD: Kazakh Offline Handwritten Text Dataset

Although digitalisation is in the trend, handwritten examinations are comfortable. There is always a need for handwritten text recognition (HTR) models to automate evaluations. It is also challenging because of the virtually infinite number of ways a letter/word can be written by the very same person. The dataset used in the study is **Kazakh offline Handwritten Text Recognition (KOHTR)** dataset, which comprises of:
- 3000 handwritten exam scripts
- &gt;140335 image semgnets
- ~ 922010 symbols
